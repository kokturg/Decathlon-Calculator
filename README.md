# Decathlon-Calculator


The task is about Decathlon competition.

 

The input of the Java program is a CSV file (see the attachment, please do not try to open it with Excel, use some simple text editor). The program should output an XML (to standard output) with all athletes in ascending order of their places, containing all the input data plus total score and the place in the competition (in case of equal scores, athletes must share the places, e.g. 3-4 and 3-4 instead of 3 and 4).

Formulas for points counting can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decathlon (see formulas at the end of the page).
